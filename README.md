# Asphalt Quality Classification Using Faster R-CNN

This repository contains the code and resources for my thesis titled **"Asphalt Quality Classification Using Faster R-CNN"**. The goal of this project is to classify different types of asphalt defects and conditions using the Faster R-CNN deep learning algorithm, leveraging object detection techniques to assess road quality.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are:

- **Develop a model** that can classify and detect various asphalt defects.
- **Train a Faster R-CNN** using a dataset of asphalt images with labeled defects.
- **Evaluate the model's performance** in identifying common road conditions, including cracks, potholes, and other types of surface degradation.
- **Apply transfer learning** techniques to enhance the accuracy of the model in real-world scenarios.
- **Create a tool** that can assist in the automatic monitoring and maintenance of road infrastructure.

## Project Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `results/`: Output of trained models
- `study/`: Lots of examples of this jorney
- `utils/`: Main library with calculations
- `README.md`: Project documentation (this file)
- Files train1.ipynb to train8.ipynb - To train the algoritm

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gleisoncs/tcc1.git
   cd tcc1

2. Open it in a VSCode with a Jupyter Notebook plugin

3. Run study\download-data.ipynb

4. Execute step by step of train1 to train8.
